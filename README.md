# UT25 Mechanical Braking System Development

## Introduction
This project focuses on the development of the UTFR Mechanical Braking System, ensuring precision and strict adherence to engineering standards and Formula Student Competition rules. The work involved managing design reviews and setting key milestones for DFA, DFC, and DFM on various components. The project aimed to uphold mechanical fundamentals and efficient practices in braking system design. A key responsibility was the integration of regenerative actuators to recover braking energy, enhancing the vehicle's energy efficiency and performance.

3.1.2.3 Calculations

This multiphysics sheet includes the ongoing development of the UTFR Mechanical Braking System, with a focus on ensuring precision and strict adherence to engineering standards and Formula Student Competition rules. Since the first braking system was implemented on the car, this dedicated calculation sheet has been in created to assess braking performance. As the UT25 Braking System Lead, I am responsible for making adjustments and updating the new design parameters in this sheet to ensure compliance with engineering standards and the physical requirements of the vehicle on track.

3.2 Floating Rotors:

The rotors were created by the previous Braking System Lead and will continue to be used due to their high thermal efficiency and reliable mechanical design. My responsibility is to ensure that the rotors can be installed with the calipers on the updated suspension system, which includes the upright and hub.
